ACE [ACW] > ### SCP-01990

**Item Number:** SCP-01990

**Object Class:** Biological Organism

**Special Containment Procedures:**

SCP-01990 is currently being held at the Advanced Research Complex (ARC) in Tokyo, Japan under controlled containment to ensure its health and safety during its extended isolation period.

The ARC's biosecurity protocol prioritizes the use of strict containment measures:
- **Temperature-Controlled Environment:** SCP-01990 will be housed within a specially designed temperature-controlled chamber that maintains a stable environment between 75°F (24°C) and 86°F (30°C).
- **Isolation Area:** A designated area inside the chamber, which includes secure observation rooms for human and non-human observers.
- **Medical Monitoring:** Regular medical evaluations, including X-rays, blood tests, and neuroimaging scans, will be conducted to monitor SCP-01990's physical well-being and identify any abnormalities.

**Description:**
SCP-01990 is a genetically-engineered organism possessing advanced neural networks that allows it to exhibit various forms of intelligence and consciousness. Its unique ability to respond to stimuli through neural signals has led to significant advancements in technology, particularly in artificial neural network research. The organization behind SCP-01990 aims to uncover its true nature, as there have been reports of anomalous behaviors and anomalies observed within its isolated living quarters.

**Addendum:**

Despite the stringent measures in place, SCP-01990 has also exhibited signs of emotional distress. It has expressed a desire for privacy and solitude, often displaying signs of stress or confusion when approached by humans outside its restricted area.
