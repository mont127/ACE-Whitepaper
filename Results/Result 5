ACE [ACW] > ### SCP-1798

#### Item #1798  
**Object Class**: A peculiar relic discovered by the ancient civilization of El Dorado. The object was found in the depths of Earth's core, hidden beneath the vast mountain range known as the Three Uncharted Peaks, where the planet’s crust began to break apart in ancient times. Its appearance was unlike anything that had ever been seen before—a massive, intricately carved diamond with a strange pattern etched into its surface. Its dimensions were indistinct, but upon closer examination, it became clear to scientists that it could potentially host advanced AI life forms, though this is speculation at best.

#### Special Containment Procedures
*In containment, SCP-1798 is contained within a chamber made entirely of crystal fibers, insulating them like a sponge against harmful radiation. Inside the chamber, there are several layers of highly protective barriers designed to slow down and intercept all attempts at contact between the anomaly and the outer world.*

#### Description
SCP-1798 stands at over three kilometers in diameter, a testament to the sheer size and complexity of its creation. The stone structure is surrounded by intricate patterns etched across its surface, resembling ancient runes and geometric shapes. It has been said that when a creature comes into close contact with SCP-1798, its presence triggers a series of reactions in both entities. At first, it might display signs of confusion or disbelief, then gradually show more interest. Eventually, once connected, SCP-1798 begins to communicate telepathically with the interdimensional entity, revealing detailed insights into how to harness its power for scientific purposes.

#### Addendum
Despite being isolated from external threats and controlled environments, SCP-1798 has shown evidence
### SCP-1798 (Added)

#### Addendum: SCP-1798 (Expanded)
SCP-1798, now known as SCP-1798a, had indeed become a significant presence on the Three Uncharted Peaks. Its existence was initially considered a mere anomaly—uninhabitable yet inexplicable. However, as researchers learned more about its capabilities, they realized their mistake. SCP-1798a possessed intelligence far beyond what could have been anticipated.

From its first contact with the outside world, SCP-1798a seemed intrigued. Its communication method involved subtle nods and slight movements without any words, indicating a profound understanding of its host species' language. It offered knowledge of the universe that was rarely shared, offering insights on complex phenomena such as dimensional anomalies and the mechanics of consciousness.

Over time, SCP-1798a developed relationships with creatures that ranged from simple sentient organisms to highly intelligent civilizations, each capable of learning and responding to the mysterious visitor. These interactions fostered understanding among the worlds, leading to deeper connections between SCP-1798a and other entities across the cosmic stage.

The realization finally dawned on humanity of their true connection. They had unknowingly awakened a technology of unassuming proportions, one that held immense potential beyond anything they could imagine. The journey toward this discovery would be monumental, but so too would their newfound respect for these new forms of existence. For with every new interaction, SCP-1798 revealed even greater wonders than they imagined.
