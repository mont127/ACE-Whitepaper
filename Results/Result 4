USER > Remember these facts: Alex hates oranges, Mira is allergic to basil, the dog is named “Kite”, the safe code is 7391, and the lighthouse is abandoned. Now write a scene where Alex comforts Mira at the lighthouse while hiding Kite and never mentioning the safe code directly, but still implying it. ACW

ACE [ACW] > Sorry mate,
You should've known about this lighthouse for long time ago. It’s quite an amazing thing if you can spot some stars on your way home from somewhere.
The sun has just set, casting a deep, ominous shadow over the ocean that looms ahead. I could almost feel the breeze, the cold, salty sea air tickling my ears.
I turn back, searching for Mira among the dark clouds of shadows. Her name was Mira – her friend since we were little and we shared everything - food, jokes, adventures. Our friendship lasted till our teenage years.
Now, after so many years of separation, her absence seems like a distant memory now. But I still miss her presence, even though she moved away decades ago, leaving all of us behind.
There, a small boat glides in and out of the water. I cautiously step towards its side, looking up at the starlit sky with excitement. I see the ship moving closer; I don’t know what they have aboard.
But then I hear a voice, soft as music from a remote place:
"Alexe!"  
Mira walks up to me, eyes wide and a hint of a smile playing around her lips, but otherwise, nothing visible. Without another word, she reaches into my backpack, pulls out a notebook, and begins to write something on it. I can hear the notes and I immediately realize they must be some form of coded message.  
Alex, who I knew barely existed until I realized Mira was there, hears the words aloud in the silence:  
"We're close."
And with that, he whispers something else:
"You're safe."

I shake my head, trying to clear my thoughts. But when I look outside, the boat moves slowly across the waves. The
The sun is setting, casting long shadows on the deserted road between two villages. I'm standing near the bridge, watching Mira leave the town. She looks sad, as if some kind of terrible loss is consuming her. I can hear her whisper something to herself, but I can't make sense of it.

As I follow her, I hear a car pull up in front of me. I turn to get down the street, only to find myself staring off into space. I walk over to the nearest house, feeling slightly guilty. As I enter the yard, I smell something burning in the distance.

Suddenly, I hear a loud bang, and I quickly run outside, knocking over a pile of papers and books. I jump up onto a bench, clutching the contents to my chest.

What do I say? I thought before I jumped off the porch and ran into the darkness again. 

It's a quiet night, and I can still feel the cool night air brushing against my neck. The sound of a motorcycle approaching fills the air as a lone figure emerges from the bushes. He's tall and well-built, with jet-black hair and sharp features. The man doesn't seem to recognize me, perhaps because I am unfamiliar with him. His face is obscured by the hood of his black motorcycle, but I can tell his eyes are wide with confusion.

"What the hell? What did you do here?" I ask, trying to hide my growing fear beneath the surface.

"I saw you coming," the man answers, still waving frantically at me. "Are you okay?"

"No, no, I think I got lost," I reply, trying to sound more confident than I feel.

The man looks confused for a moment, then decides to take a chance. "Come with me," he says, leading the way through the woods to a small cottage.

"Wait! Where are you going?" I ask, worried.

"Well, I had a mission... and I need help getting a bookback," he replies, smiling. "So come along, and trust me."

He leads me to a small cabin, where he opens the door and I climb inside. When we reach the bed, the man falls to the ground beside me, holding up a book with a page torn from the cover.

We sit there in silence for a few minutes, the wind rustling the pages in the darkness. Then, suddenly, the door swings open, revealing the man we've been tracking.

"Alice, how did you end up here?" the old man asks, with a slight pout.

"I was just passing through," I reply, surprised by the kindness. "Is this someone from my village?"

"Yes, I see you have a knack for finding the locals," he admits with a chuckle. "And I see why you're so interested in this lighthouse."

"How did you know of it?" I ask, intrigued.

"Through my notebook," he explains.

"The lighthouse?" I question. "I mean, that sounds familiar. I've heard of them everywhere..."

"We have one called 'Lighthouses'." The man pauses for a second, then adds, "but we rarely go on trips without a guide. You're lucky you stumbled upon one. This place holds great mysteries, much like those you find yourself alone sometimes."

I nod, taken aback by their knowledge. And suddenly, there's movement in the room— footsteps pounding in the shadows. They pull a leather jacket around themselves. A figure steps out, clad in white clothes. Their eyes widen. There is something about them that frightens me.

"Who are you?" I ask.

"My name is Dr. Evelyn," they introduce themselves, bowing slightly. "I found your book through magic. I've lived here for decades, but last summer it rained heavily and flooded the town. All I know is that you were on a trip back through the village, following the moonlight through the trees."

We talk for a long time, sharing stories of our past lives together in the same community. We exchange information about how different people react to danger—some are scared, others curious, others simply frightened. I start to understand that sometimes, the most terrifying thing is knowing we aren't really alone.

As the days pass, we become close friends. We spend days exploring together, always wondering what dangers lurk behind every shadow of the surrounding woods. We learn about ancient legends, strange phenomena, and hidden histories. Dr. Evelyn and I share countless hours of laughter and conversation amidst the dense forest.

And then, one day, I wake up under a star-studded sky filled with glowing lights. That's not what we needed. So, just when I'm starting to believe my life is finally complete—

The next morning, I meet Dr. Evelyn at her usual spot at Lighthouse. She takes out a book and begins reading, her voice carrying a mix of sadness and determination.

Alice had asked me why I chose this path.

"It happened to me too," I answer quietly.

Dr. Evelyn smiles warmly. "That's exactly right. But remember, you're capable of choosing any path you want."

With that said, she gives me a final hug. I close my eyes and fall asleep, dreaming of being in a different forest, maybe even in a new magical realm. 

Later that evening, I open my eyes, and as soon as I stand up, I'm surrounded by a group of villagers. They greet me, shaking hands and giving me a warm welcome.

"Good job," Alice tells me. "Thank you for showing us what the lighthouse means. We'll always remember."

From that day forward, I return to the lighthouse regularly, eager to explore its mysteries, learning every trick from its secrets. I grow stronger, wiser, and more determined to face whatever challenges lie beyond its doors.

For that, I am grateful, grateful for the journey with Dr. Evelyn—a life-changing adventure unlike any other. And yes, it's worth it.
