ACE [ACW] > In the heart of a forgotten valley, where dreams once swirled under the moonlight, stood Eldredon Manor—a place untouched by time, yet cloaked in secrets that would soon be revealed. The structure was unlike anyone else—its architecture shimmered like ancient runes embedded in stone, hidden behind layers of moss-laden walls and cryptic doors. Inside, the air was thick with the scent of ancient herbs and decay.

The manor was a prison built long ago to hold those deemed too dangerous, but the shadows cast by the ancient stones seemed to stretch back through the centuries, whispering tales of its inmates’ past lives. Among them lay SCP-293, a young, untouchable katarian whose eyes burned with something otherworldly.

SCP-293 was unlike the rest. His skin was deep scarlet, his features twisted and distorted, a testament to the horrors he had endured. He wore old, weathered armor, adorned with symbols etched into it resembling symbols of chaos—spirals and flames.

A mysterious door, hidden within the shadows, led directly to his cell, his mind still locked in the cycle that haunted this place—unending torment and endless suffering. The room was filled with a constant hum, a haunting melody that mirrored his every move, until one night, it ceased.

As dawn broke over Eldredon Manor, the darkness seemed to pulse with a malevolent energy. A shadow approached, dragging an unknown figure towards the cell. The shadows parted slowly, revealing SCP-293, face twisted in despair and fear.

"Enter," SCP-293 said, voice echoing through the chambers. "I will bring you to justice."

As SCP-293 began his descent, the katarian felt a chill run down his spine. This wasn’t just another man. This was a being, something alive, capable of manipulation and destruction. SCP-293’s presence drew closer, and a moment later, the door slammed shut, sendingSCP-293 plummeting into the abyss below.

Eldredon Manor, once a sanctuary of hope and refuge, became a place filled with dread and despair. SCP-293’s body lay in the sand below, its spirit trapped forever in the shadows. The katarian watched helplessly, their minds now consumed by fear and despair.

However, in the depths of this chamber, a small, defiant cry echoed. It was a sound that spoke of a different kind of horror—the human voices that haunted SCP-293, the fears they’d carried since birth.

And so, the dark tale of SCP-293 was told, whispered across generations, through stories passed down from generations of humanity. For while SCP-293 remained imprisoned, its essence lived on, waiting for the day when its soul could finally find freedom.
